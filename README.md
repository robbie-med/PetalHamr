# About
## Overview

The Pediatric Vitals Drill App is a lightweight, interactive game designed to help reinforce pediatric clinical skills. The app presents a one-line clinical scenario‚Äîincluding weight and 1 to 4 vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, or 24‚Äëhr urine output). Users quickly input a free-text answer (e.g., ‚Äúfever, hypotens‚Äù) which is then evaluated by an AI using the GPT-4o model. Based on the evaluation, the user‚Äôs score is adjusted (+1 for correct, ‚Äì1 for incorrect or timeout).

## Features

- **Rapid Drilling:** Learn to quickly assess pediatric vitals with one-line clinical scenarios.
- **Customizable Timer:** Adjustable answer time (1 to 10 seconds) via a slider. If the timer runs out, a ‚Äì1 penalty is applied.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Visual feedback with a red screen flash for every incorrect answer.
- **AI Integration:** Uses the GPT-4o model via an API to evaluate free-text responses.
- **Lightweight & Accessible:** Simple design and hosted on GitHub for easy access and contribution.
